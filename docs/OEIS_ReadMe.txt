The goal of the project is to analyze automatically the data in the Online-Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences 


More descriptions of the project and data is available in the project's website:

Data files: 
We've downlaoded the data files for sequences and names from here: 


stripped - an ID and sequence values for each sequence 
names - an ID, name and textual description of each sequences

There are 272,816 different sequences 



(1.) Filtering 




(2.) Clustering 
Here the goal is to cluster sequences into different groups. We would like to identify and describe the major clusters, their sizes, and their
relationships.
